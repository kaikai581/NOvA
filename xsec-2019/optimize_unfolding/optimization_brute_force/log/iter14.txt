Warning! HistCache memory usage exceeds 500MB. That probably means histograms are being returned to the cache that weren't originally handed out by it.
Gave out 3 histograms, got back 3 of them (0 lost), in 1 different shapes.
Holding 2 histograms for an estimated memory usage of 734735232 bytes.
Now clearing cache. This could take a long time...
