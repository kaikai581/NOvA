Like what we found in 2018, when we looked at systematic uncertainties in neutrino energy,
the uncertainties exploded with >40%.

Later we found only 1/7 of the detector systematic samples were created with the correct
calibration constants.

All the above was done with the "check_light_syst" folder.

Now that we know what are wrong and what are not affected, I use "plot_systs" for
investigating the unaffected systematics.
